			<div class="bg-white">
				<p class="explanation">Choose a typeface that is appropriate to the context. Some typefaces are good for text, some are good for display, others have their own special uses. <br><br>Display type should be chosen for visual appeal, body text for visual texture, legibility, and readability.</p>

			<div class="bg-white">

				<h3>Which option has a better leading?</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="bg-white">

				<h3>What is the default alignment?</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="bg-white">
				<p class="explanation">In typesetting and page layout, alignment is the setting of text flow or image placement relative to a page, column (measure), table cell, or tab. There are 4 alignments: flushed left, flushed right, justified and centered. <br>
					<br>
				If in doubt, align paragraphs to the left and don't justify, since it is the default alignment.</p>

				<h3>Which of these has a better justification? </h3>
			</div>
			<div class="bg-white">
				<p class="explanation">If you must justify paragraphs, do it with care. Badly justified text ends up with awkward spacing that can leave ‘rivers’ of white space running down the paragraph or excessive hyphenation at the end of the lines.</p>

				<h3>What do you call a word alone<br> at the end of a paragraph?</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="bg-white">
				<p class="explanation">Don’t leave words on their own at the end of a paragraph (widows) or even worse, let the last line of a paragraph sit on its own at the top of a column or page (orphans). </p>

			<div class="white">
				<h3>Is it correct to use double spaces between<br> sentences to emphasize the difference?</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="bg-white">
				<p class="explanation">Use single spaces between sentences. Double spaces break the overall texture of the paragraph.</p>

				<h3>What's the most correct way to quote someone<br> when it comes to punctuation?</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="bg-white">
				<p class="explanation">Always take care with punctuation. Use smart (curly) quotes instead of dumb quotes. Learn to use dashes and hyphens correctly. They are not interchangeable. Use real fraction characters, trademark and copyright symbols, not alphabetic approximations.</p>

				<h3>What background makes the text more readable?</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="bg-white">
				<p class="explanation">Don’t put body text over a background that will make it harder to read. Light colored text is readable on a dark background and vice-versa. If you use colors with a close hue the text will be harder to read aswell. </p>
